Rules for relational schema design, migrations, indexes, transactions, connections, personal data and backups. Apply
when you change a schema, write a migration or data-access code, or touch backups; SQL covers writing the SQL itself.

## Migrations

Schema changes are the riskiest part of a deploy: they run against live data and are hard to undo.

#### Version every schema change as a reviewed migration
<!-- rule: id=DB-1 enforcement=rule -->
Make every schema and reference-data change a versioned migration in the repository, applied by the migration tool in
each environment. Never change a shared database by hand, and never run migrations or data fixes against a shared
environment from a session unless the person explicitly asks.

#### Keep applied migrations immutable and forward-only
<!-- rule: id=DB-2 enforcement=rule -->
Never edit, reorder or delete a migration that has run in any shared environment; correct mistakes with a new
migration. Rewriting history makes environments diverge silently and breaks the migration tool's checksums.

#### Never run a destructive migration without backup and rollback plan
<!-- rule: id=DB-3 enforcement=mandatory -->
Before any DROP, TRUNCATE, column removal, type narrowing or other irreversible data change on a shared or production
database, confirm a verified, restorable backup of the affected data and a written rollback plan. If either is
missing, stop and ask; never run it as a quick fix.

#### Change schemas with expand/contract for zero downtime
<!-- rule: id=DB-4 enforcement=rule -->
When old and new application versions run side by side during a deploy, add the new structure first (expand), deploy
code that writes both and reads the new one, backfill in batches, then remove the old structure in a later release
(contract). Every intermediate state must work with both versions.

## Schema and integrity

The database is the last line of defence for correct data; constraints hold even when application code is wrong.

#### Enforce invariants with constraints in the schema
<!-- rule: id=DB-5 enforcement=rule -->
Declare NOT NULL, primary keys, foreign keys, UNIQUE and CHECK constraints for every invariant the data must satisfy
instead of relying on application validation alone; constraints also catch concurrent writes, bugs and other clients.

#### Store timestamps in UTC with time-zone-aware types
<!-- rule: id=DB-6 enforcement=rule -->
Store instants in UTC in a time-zone-aware type (timestamptz in PostgreSQL, datetimeoffset in SQL Server; in MySQL a
DATETIME holding UTC), never as strings, and convert to local time only for display. Keep a separate IANA time-zone
column when local wall-clock time matters, e.g. for scheduling.

#### Store money as exact decimals or integer minor units
<!-- rule: id=DB-7 enforcement=rule -->
Store amounts as DECIMAL/NUMERIC with a fixed scale or as integer minor units (cents), always with an ISO 4217
currency code. Never use FLOAT, REAL or DOUBLE for money: binary floating point cannot represent most decimal
fractions and rounding errors accumulate.

## Indexes

Most database incidents are slow queries and lock contention that appear only at production data volumes.

#### Design indexes from real query patterns
<!-- rule: id=DB-8 enforcement=rule -->
Index the predicates, joins and sorts the application actually runs, composite columns equality-first then range,
and every foreign key used in joins or cascading deletes (PostgreSQL does not index them automatically). Check plans
with EXPLAIN as SQL describes, and drop unused indexes: each one slows writes.

## Transactions and connections

Correctness under concurrency and stability under load depend on how transactions and connections are used.

#### Use short explicit transactions and know the isolation level
<!-- rule: id=DB-9 enforcement=rule -->
Wrap each multi-statement unit of work in one short explicit transaction and never hold it open across network calls
or user input. Know the database's default isolation level (often READ COMMITTED) and prevent lost updates with row
locks, version columns or SERIALIZABLE with retries.

#### Pool connections and set statement timeouts
<!-- rule: id=DB-10 enforcement=rule -->
Connect through a bounded pool sized against the database's connection limit across all instances, and set statement
and lock timeouts (e.g. PostgreSQL statement_timeout and lock_timeout) so one runaway query cannot exhaust connections
or block a table.

## Data protection and recovery

Stored personal data is a liability, and a backup is worth only what its last successful restore proves.

#### Minimise and protect personal data
<!-- rule: id=DB-11 enforcement=rule -->
Store only the personal data a feature needs, mark those columns, encrypt sensitive ones at rest where the threat model
requires it and restrict access by role. Implement the retention period with deletion or anonymisation, and never copy
production personal data into development databases.

#### Test backup restores on a schedule
<!-- rule: id=DB-12 enforcement=rule -->
Treat a backup as valid only after a restore succeeded: restore regularly into an isolated environment, run integrity
and row-count checks, and record the achieved recovery time and recovery point against the agreed RTO and RPO.
