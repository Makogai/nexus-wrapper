Rules for writing Dockerfiles and Compose files. Apply when you create or change them; OPS covers CI, running
containers and deployment.

## Base images and layers

The base image and layer order decide image size, patch level and build speed.

#### Use slim base images pinned by version and digest
<!-- rule: id=DKR-1 enforcement=rule -->
Base images on a specific version tag of a slim or distroless variant (node:24.11-slim, not node or node:latest) and
pin production images by digest as well (`image:tag@sha256:<digest>`), letting an update bot such as Renovate raise
tag and digest together.

#### Use multi-stage builds with named stages
<!-- rule: id=DKR-2 enforcement=rule -->
Name stages (FROM node:24.11-slim AS build) and copy only built artefacts into the final stage with COPY --from=build,
so compilers, package caches and sources never ship. Keep test and dev tooling in separate stages selected with
--target, so one Dockerfile serves CI and production.

#### Order layers for cache efficiency
<!-- rule: id=DKR-3 enforcement=rule -->
Copy dependency manifests and lockfiles first, install dependencies, then copy the source, so code changes do not
invalidate the dependency layer. Use RUN --mount=type=cache for package caches, and run apt-get update, install and
cleanup in one RUN.

#### Copy only what the image needs
<!-- rule: id=DKR-4 enforcement=rule -->
Use COPY, not ADD (which also fetches URLs and unpacks archives), copy explicit paths, and keep a .dockerignore,
ideally allowlist-style (* then !needed paths), that excludes .git, dependency folders, build output, env files and
test data, so builds stay fast and nothing private reaches the builder.

## Runtime and secrets

How the container process runs decides its privileges, whether it stops cleanly and what leaks into the image.

#### Run as a non-root user with a numeric UID
<!-- rule: id=DKR-5 enforcement=rule -->
Switch to an unprivileged user with a fixed numeric UID (USER 10001, or the image's built-in user such as node) before
CMD, and set file ownership with COPY --chown. Numeric UIDs let orchestrators verify runAsNonRoot.

#### Run one concern per container in exec form
<!-- rule: id=DKR-6 enforcement=rule -->
Run one main process per container (web, worker and scheduler as separate services from the same image) instead of
supervisord bundles. Use exec-form CMD or ENTRYPOINT (JSON array) so the process is PID 1 and gets SIGTERM; add --init
or tini if it spawns children.

#### Declare a HEALTHCHECK that works inside the image
<!-- rule: id=DKR-7 enforcement=rule -->
Add a HEALTHCHECK with interval, timeout, start period and retries for images run by Docker or Compose, using a
command that exists in the final image (an app health subcommand on distroless, not a missing curl). Kubernetes
ignores it and uses probes (OPS-6).

#### Keep secrets out of images, build args and Compose files
<!-- rule: id=DKR-8 enforcement=mandatory -->
Never put secrets in a Dockerfile, ARG, ENV, copied file or compose file: they persist in image layers and history.
Use BuildKit secret mounts (RUN --mount=type=secret with docker build --secret) at build time and the platform's
secret store at runtime, and commit only an .env.example. A secret that reached an image is compromised (SEC-1).

## Compose and tooling

Compose makes local dependencies reproducible; a Dockerfile linter catches what review misses.

#### Use Compose for local development with named volumes
<!-- rule: id=DKR-9 enforcement=rule -->
Define local dependencies (database, cache, broker) in compose.yaml without the obsolete top-level version key, with
pinned images, named volumes for data and healthchecks plus depends_on condition: service_healthy. Run it with
docker compose (v2), keep production settings out of it and never commit env files with values.

#### Lint Dockerfiles with hadolint
<!-- rule: id=DKR-10 enforcement=rule check=lint -->
Run hadolint on every Dockerfile in CI and fix findings (unpinned packages, missing --no-install-recommends,
shell-form CMD) rather than ignoring them; document any inline ignore with the reason.
